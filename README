      An interface to the micro-typographic extensions of pdfTeX
                =================================
                       v2.1     2007/01/21


* Overview
 ----------

The `microtype' package provides an interface  to  the  micro-typographic
extensions  of  pdfTeX:  most  prominently, character protrusion and font
expansion, furthermore the adjustment of interword spacing and additional
kerning,  as well as a command for  robust and hyphenatable letterspacing
and the possibility to disable all ligatures of a font.
It allows to apply these features  to customisable sets of fonts,  and to
configure all micro-typographic aspects of the fonts in a straightforward
and flexible way. Settings for various fonts are provided. 

Note that  font expansion  and  character protrusion  will only work with
pdfTeX, at least version 0.14f. Automatic font expansion requires version
1.20 or newer.  Disabling ligatures requires  pdfTeX 1.30,  letterspacing
and the adjustment of interword spacing  and of kerning  requires version
1.40. The package will by default enable protrusion and expansion if they
can safely be assumed to work. 

The  alternative package  `letterspace'  provides  the user commands  for
letterspacing only, omitting support for all other extensions. 

The documentation can be found in microtype.pdf.


* Installation
 --------------

 - Run latex on microtype.ins to generate the package and configuration files
 - Move all files into a directory where LaTeX will find them,
   e.g. TEXMF/tex/latex/microtype

 - Run (pdf)latex twice on microtype.dtx to create the documentation
 - For an index run:
      makeindex -s gind.ist -o microtype.ind microtype.idx
 - For the change history run:
      makeindex -s gglo.ist -o microtype.gls microtype.glo
