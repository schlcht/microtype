 `Margin kerning is the \textls*[1200]{adjustments of the characters at the margins} of a
  typeset text. A simplified employment of margin kerning is \textls{hanging
  punctuation}. Margin kerning is needed for \textls{optical alignment} of the margins
  of a typeset text, because mechanical justification of the margins makes
  them look rather ragged. Some characters can make a line appear shorter to
  the human eye than others. Shifting such characters by an appropriate
  amount into the margins would greatly improve the appearance of a typeset
  text.
